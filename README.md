Third Party Packages used:

Tailwind CSS: npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest --save
npx tailwind init -p

IonIcons: npm install @reacticons/ionicons --save

To run the code, open terminal by using these commands from WS2_ASSIGN1:
cd guitar_store
npm install
npm run dev

The Process of Creating the Website:

- I started by creating a React project from an empty folder by using the command npx create-vite@latest guitar-store --template react
- I then installed the Tailwind CSS and IonIcons packages by running the commands, npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest --save
  npx tailwind init -p and npm install @reacticons/ionicons --save
- After checking that everything works, I started making the three most easiest components Header, Banner, and Footer.
- For the first three components, I find it easy because there are no deep interactivity needed just the hover animation.
- The most challenging part was the Products component. To do this, I had to check the week 5 folder for references.
